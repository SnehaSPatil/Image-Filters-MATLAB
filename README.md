# Image-Filters-MATLAB
 In this assignment we consider two three filters: mean filter, Gaussian filter, median filter. The mean filter, the Gaussian filter are the linear filters while the median filter is anon linear filter. The mean filter reduces noise when the kernel size is optimal, but on choosing excessively large kernel the image loses edge sharpness and is blurred. The mean filter basically reduces the amount of intensity variation between one pixel and the next. The salt and pepper noise is only attenuated by the mean filter, it is not removed. The Gaussian filter removes the high frequency component from the image. It thus acts like a low pass filter. It works better than the mean filter in removing the Gaussian noise. Excessively large width of the kernel causes blurring of images even with the Gaussian filter. The median filter is a nonlinear filter. It works the best on the salt and pepper noise affected images, since it takes a median of the pixels in the neighborhood. It thus does not let the single very unrepresentative pixel in a neighborhood affect the median value significantly. Greater the size of the filter the more is the reduction of the salt and pepper noise. The median filter however lets great deal of high spatial frequency detail to pass and is thus less effective on the images corrupted by Gaussian noise compared to the Gaussian filter.
